          Your interior space will never be the same as the three-seatersss sofa as its centerpiece. Polyester is a
          category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in their main chain. As a specific material, it
          most commonly refers to a type called polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Polyesters include naturally occurring
          chemicals, such as in the cutin of plant cuticles, as well as synthetics such as polybutyrate. Natural
          polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. The material is
          used extensively in clothing.
