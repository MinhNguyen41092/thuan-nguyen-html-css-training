          This is a nice-looking sofa. Similar to another reviewer, I had an issue with the brackets on the armrest and the seat back being installed upside down and reversed (the bracket that belonged on the armrest first had to be removed from the seat back, and screwed onto the armrest, and vice versa). This made assembly take a bit longer. I
          called customer service and they were able to resolve the issue quickly and to my satisfaction. Wayfair has the best and easiest customer service that I have experienced in a long time!

          Bought the cream/beige color and it is fantastic! The fabric is soft and looks like linen without the uncomfortability of linen. The seat cushions are on the firmer side, but will probably break in with use. Putting it together was overall decently easy. Arms could have been easier to attach to the couch. The back was missing a bolt hole
          for me to attach a bolt in for stability, but feels pretty stable anyway.
